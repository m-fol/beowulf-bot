Beowulf-Bot is a Discord bot that gets its namesake from Beowulf, a character from the fighting game Skullgirls <i>(cause he's my favorite, there's really not much thought here)</i>.</p> Retrieves Google Drive file status and provide updates to your team about the last time a file was edited. Uses commands like !fileinfo and !last, helping keep track of file activity within specified folders. <img src="https://github.com/m-fol/beowulf-bot/assets/139060140/cff59273-d8f6-4b83-815a-114f522cc0f0" alt="Image"  height="20">
